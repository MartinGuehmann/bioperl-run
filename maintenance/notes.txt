Solving the prereqs/tests problem for bioperl-run

* Treat each package in Bio/Tools/Run as an optional feature, and
* Allow user to choose at build time which run packages to install

This makes sense; few users are likely to want to wrap every program
that is supported; many users are likely to want to wrap one or two

* For _each_ package in Bio/Tools/Run, keep track of the prereqs in 
  (CPAN::Meta::Spec-compliant) metadata

Must bite this bullet for bioperl-run to act independently

* Associate the BioPerl core modules with their split-out
  packages

That is, be formal and proactive about describing the split-out
distributions in (publicly available, CPAN::Meta::Spec-compliant)
metadata. This metadata should include 'provides' information, and 
'resources' information, so that bp-run Build can go out and install
the correct latest distros to fulfil prereqs. (I.e., say goodbye to 1.0069)

* Within each test, use CPAN::Meta classes to query prerequisites
  directly from the distro's formal META

To make the run distro (and all the splitout distros) behave together
robustly, we need a common standard for describing within-BioPerl
dependencies, and a convention for querying those dependencies. The
CPAN::Meta suite provides exactly this.
